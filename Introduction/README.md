DaturaCTF is a database for **ideas** and **tools** to use in CTF competitions. It's purpose is to help the user (usually me) to find solutions and provide some tools to use when offline.

The tools that I use most often are marked with a heart :heart: symbol.

This database was mostly made from [CTF Katana](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana) and [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz), but also from tools found along the way. I do not own most of this content, I just gathered it in one place. Credit goes to the original authors, linked in the different sections.

Most of the tools are written in Python and are designed to be used in a Linux environment.
