* `Private IPs`

    Some ip ranges are reserved for private networks. They are not routable on the internet. They are:

    | Network | Range | Count |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `10.0.0.0/8` | `10.0.0.0` â€“ `10.255.255.255` | 16,777,214 |
    | `172.16.0.0/16` | `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255` | 1,048,574 |
    | `192.168.0.0/16` | `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255` | 65,534 |




* `nmap` - [Website](https://nmap.org/)

    `nmap` is a utility for network discovery.

	```bash
	nmap -sC -sV -O 192.168.0.0/24 # Classic scan
	nmap -sS 192.168.0.0/24        # SYN scan (faster but no service detection)
	```


* `Nmap scripts` - [Website](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/)
  
	`nmap` has a lot of scripts that can be used to scan for specific vulnerabilities. They are called with the `--script` option.
