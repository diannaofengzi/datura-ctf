Different types of exploit exists, the most common are:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Format String](../Tools/ELF/6-format_string_vulns/) | Exploits format string functions to read and write in the program memory |
| [Overwriting stack variables](../Tools/ELF/1-overwriting_stack_variables/) | Change the value of a variable on the stack. |
| [ret2win](../Tools/ELF/3-ret2win_with_params/) | Overwrite the return address to point to an interesting function of the program |
| [Shellcode](../Tools/ELF/4-injecting_custom_shellcode/) | Inject shellcode in the program memory and execute it |
| [ret2libc](../Tools/ELF/5-return_to_libc/) | Overwrite the return address to point to an intersting function in libc |
| [Overwriting GOT](../Tools/ELF/8-overwriting_got/) | Overwrite the address of a function in the GOT to point to an interesting function |

But some security mechanisms exists and can be bypassed:

- ASLR
Randomization of the memory addresses of the program and the libraries.
Solution: Leak an adress and calculate the offset between the leaked address and the address of the function you want to call.

- NX
No execution of the stack.

- Stack canaries
A random value is stored on the stack and checked before returning from a function.
Solution: [Leak the canary](../Tools/ELF/9-bypassing_canaries/) and overwrite it with the correct value.

- PIE
Randomization of the memory addresses of the program.
Solution: [Leak an adress](../Tools/ELF/7-leak_pie_ret2libc/)
